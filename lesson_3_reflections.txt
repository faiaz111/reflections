When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository rather keeping all my work local when there is multiple people working on the same project. In this way,
everyone can contribute to the project and individual's work can be shared with others working in the project. I can also use a remote 
repository to share my own public projects with others so that eveyone else can use my project for their own project.
